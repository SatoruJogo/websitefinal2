    "title4" : "Threats to Population",
    "content3": "Given the growing overlap in the populations of humans and leopards, the conflict between the two species in Sri Lanka is a complicated and difficult problem. Humans and leopards come into greater contact as a result of rapid urbanisation and encroachment into natural areas, which can result in conflicts over territory and resources. Leopards, especially the Sri Lankan Leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya), have been known to raid settlements in pursuit of food or to face habitat fragmentation, which has led to conflicts with the local populace.",
    "title5": "Habitats",
    "content4": "The Sri Lankan leopard is still found in all habitats throughout the island in both protected and unprotected areas. These habitat types can be broadly categorised as: Arid zone, Dry zone, Wet zone. In Sri Lanka's central hills, leopards have been recorded in forest patches, tea estates, grasslands, home gardens, and pine and eucalyptus plantations."
